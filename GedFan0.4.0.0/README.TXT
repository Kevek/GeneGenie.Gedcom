THE GEDCOM FAN CREATOR

GEDFAN.EXE is The GEDCOM Fan Creator.
GedFan creates a simple n-generation ancestry, neatly filling up a fan chart.
See http://www.tamurajones.net/GedFan.xhtml

The GEDFAN uility and the FAN files (FAN1.GED, ENFAN2.GED, FRFAN3.GED etc) it creates are copyrighted. 
All rights reserved.


GEDFAN

The GedFan utility is a Windows console application; an old-fashioned command-line application that you run
from the Command Prompt.
Luckily, GEDFAN was designed as throwaway utility; once you've created the FAN files, you don't need it anymore.
You don't need to install it either, you can use it right away. 
GEDFAN does not use the registry and does not require any special privileges.
If you know how to use the command-line, you can use GedFan.

Once you see how large the FAN files get, you understand why I decided to distribute The GEDCOM Fan Creator instead.


THE FAN FILES

GedFan creates a simple n-generation ancestry, neatly filling up a fan chart.
These FAN files are great for displaying and explaining ahnen numbering. 
See http://www.tamurajones.net/AhnenNumbering.xhtml for an explanation of ahnen numbering that does not use the FAN file,
but the original ahnentafel.


These FAN files get large quickly. 
That makes the FAN files great for testing both GEDCOM import speed and memory usage.
The largest FAN file an application can handle is known as its GEDCOM fan-factor.


LICENSE

You are granted a limited, personal, non-transferable right to use the FAN files, 
to explain anhnen numbering and for testing genealogy software, provided that you:
* Always clearly indicate which GedFan version you used to create the FAN files.
* Always provide a link back to http://www.tamurajones.net/GedFan.xhtml, including "GedFan" in the link title.

Example text:
The FAN database used in the Family Tree Maker screenshot was generated by GedFan 0.3.4.0.

REQUIREMENTS

GedFan is a Win32 console application.
It requires a 32-bit version of Windows to run.
All 64-bit editions of Windows support 32-bit applications.
The largest files it creates are several gigabytes in size.
In fact, although a 32-bit application, GedFan can created files larger 4 GB.
The "GedFan" article contains a table that indicates file size.
