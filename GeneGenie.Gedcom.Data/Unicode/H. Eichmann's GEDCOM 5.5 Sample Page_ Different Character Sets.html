Characters (letters) with a value between 20 and 7F (hexadecimal values) are no problem in GEDCOM files.
They are defined in the ASCII code and are available worldwide.
Other characters not defined in ASCII are a big problem. Windows (and DOS)
defines code pages which contain some important special characters of a 
part of the world (example: code page 1252 in Windows and 850 in DOS define most
of the characters of Western Europe). The disadvantage of using code pages
is obvious: the meaning of a byte depends on the operating system and
on the country where it is read. Example: character D0 (hex) is a capital D with
a horizontal line (Eth) on code page 1252 (Windows, Western Europe), but it
is a small eth on code page 850 (DOS, Western Europe), a capital Pi on code
page 1253 (Windows, Greek), a capital Russian R on code page 1251
(Windows, Cyrillic) and so on. This is therefore NOT usefull for the
transmission of data.<br><br>

The GEDCOM standard allows only three character sets for the transmission
of genealogical data: ASCII, ANSEL and UNICODE. ASCII is very easy to
implement but contains no special characters. UNICODE is clearly the
future but right now not supported very much. It uses two bytes for
each character, allowing 65535 different characters. Therefore UNICODE
contains most of the characters of most of the languages worldwide.<br><br>

ANSEL (ANSI Z39.47-1985) is somewhere in between. All standard ASCII 
characters have the same value in ASCII and ANSEL. Therefore ANSEL and ASCII
transmissions can not be distinguished, if just ASCII characters are used.
Non-ASCII characters can have one or two bytes in size, which makes ANSEL
decoders very complicated and unpopular. But nevertheless in true GEDCOM
transmissions only one of these three character sets is allowed. <br><br>

This page contains 2 GEDCOM files: one in ANSEL and another in UNICODE.
The structure is the same: a family consisting of two parents and
several children. Only the NAME, BIRT.PLAC and DEAT.PLAC tags are used.
Every GEDCOM reader should be able to read them. The ANSEL version contains
all special and all non-spacing characters defined in ANSEL. Every combination
of a non-spacing and a latin character is made independent of the existence
of such a character in the world. The UNICODE version contains only those
character combinations, which exist as UNICODE code points and which can
(in principle) converted to ANSEL. Furthermore the UNICODE file contains
some Greek and Cyrillic letters.<br><br>
This ANSEL version was created using my
<a href="http://heiner-eichmann.de/gedcom/charintr.htm"> ANSEL to Unicode </a>
conversion table. I did not find the true
ANSEL specification in the web. The encoding scheme in this file can be wrong!

<br><br>

The UNICODE file was created using the UNICODE homepage:
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/">www.unicode.org</a>. 
It exsists in several versions:<br>
<li> the byte order can be Lo-Hi and Hi-Lo,<br>
</li><li> a special byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning can indicate the byte order,<br>
</li><li> the line terminator can be CR, LF, CR+LF and LF+CR<br><br>

<a href="http://heiner-eichmann.de/gedcom/ulhcl.zip">Byte order: Lo-Hi, no BOM, Line terminator: CR+LF</a><br>
<a href="http://heiner-eichmann.de/gedcom/uhlcl.zip">Byte order: Hi-LO, no BOM, Line terminator: CR+LF</a><br>
<a href="http://heiner-eichmann.de/gedcom/ulhbomcl.zip">Byte order: Lo-Hi, BOM, Line terminator: CR+LF</a><br>
<a href="http://heiner-eichmann.de/gedcom/uhlbomcl.zip">Byte order: Hi-Lo, BOM, Line terminator: CR+LF</a><br>
<a href="http://heiner-eichmann.de/gedcom/ulhl.zip">Byte order: Lo-Hi, no BOM, Line terminator: LF</a><br>
<a href="http://heiner-eichmann.de/gedcom/ulhc.zip">Byte order: Lo-Hi, no BOM, Line terminator: CR</a><br>
<a href="http://heiner-eichmann.de/gedcom/ulhlc.zip">Byte order: Lo-Hi, no BOM, Line terminator: LF+CR</a><br>
